# Example for an "advanced" introduciton to Rust

Using the example of crating our own collection let's us introduce:

- Basic syntax
- Structs
- Enums
- Exclusive and shared references
- Traits
- Basic lifteimes
- Iterators and combinators
- Advanced lifteimes
- Unsafe
- Libraries vs binaries
- Referencing local crates

This is an example meant to back up a workshop or in deapth introduction to Rust. I haven't tried
it out yet so right now it's just an idea that might come in handy later.
